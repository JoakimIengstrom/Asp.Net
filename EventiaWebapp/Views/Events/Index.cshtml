This year is shaping up to be one of the best for music festivals. Fans can look forward to events featuring their favorite performers.

<h1>Coachella</h1>
<h3>April 15-17 & 22-24, 2022 – Indio, California</h3>
You can’t have a list of music festivals without mentioning one of the biggest in the United States. Attracting more than 250,000 revelers annually, Coachella is at the top of everyone’s list of must-experience events. Aside from the music, the festival is also known for its celebrity appearances, comeback performances, and fashion sense. In fact, Coachella is considered a trendsetter in streetwear, so don’t leave home without dressing to impress. This year’s Coachella is headlined by Rage Against the Machine with an initial lineup that includes Swedish House Mafia and Travis Scott. While the official list is in the works, you might want to book your tickets early.
<h1>South by Southwest</h1>
<h3>March 11-20, 2022 – Austin, Texas</h3>
The city of Austin has been touted as the South’s progressive center. It’s for this reason that makes Austin an ideal place for innovative acts to rise. While it features a separate event for films and comedy performers, South by Southwest (popularly known as South By or SXSW) Musical Festival provides the perfect venue for up and coming bands to share the stage with established acts. Inviting over hundreds of global talents to perform in several venues across the city, SXSW is known for launching independent musicians to international recognition. If you are looking to update your Spotify playlist with the freshest bands, then head on over to Austin this March and experience what bands like Horsegirl, Family Jools, and Bread Pilot have to offer.
<h1>Ultra Music Festival</h1>
<h3>March 25-27, 2022 – Miami, Florida</h3>
South By isn’t the only musical extravaganza happening this year. If you have a taste for electronic music, then book your tickets to the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. A spectacle of light and sound, this three-day affair features veteran DJs and newcomers who are eager to bring up the noise. You may have heard of acts like David Guetta and Nicky Romero, but you might want to give performers like Julian Jordan from the Netherlands or Montreal’s Black Tiger Sex Machine a spot in your playlist. Along with Miami’s tropical attractions, joining the Ultra Music Festival would be the best way to kick-off the Spring season.
<h1>Austin City Limits Music Festival</h1>
<h3>October 7-9 & 14-16, 2022 – Austin, Texas</h3>
